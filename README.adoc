= My Unifi Stuff
:toc:

  Originally written in (early to mid) August of 2021; I really struggled to
  understand parts of the networking stack; I learned a great deal. be careful
  not to make assumptions, there are things about complex devices like this that
  can be scary at first, but also..

  Squashed commit history i used to try to diagnose my Unifi AP. Written by
  DataDog the goal of this project is to forward logs for diagnostics of
  compromised Unifi devices.

  Its very hard to build trust in something you can't comprehend or explain
  simply. This is my hope for (more) tools that can do _just that_. Explain all
  of this very, very, simply.

  Never trust just ONE person. Nor just blindly trust a collective. Find a good
  company, with good and genuine people. I loved my time at DynDNS and I'm
  excited to be part of @DigitalOcean. As much as I _do_ love them, I love them
  enough to say.. don't trust them. Don't trust me. Run the scripts for yourself,
  lookup the packets, and what they mean. Networks speak a very very simple
  language. All you have to do is listen, be patient & remain calm in the face of
  things you dont understand at the time.

== Specification

=== Network

=== Sub-Networks (VLANs)

- IPv4 addresses match VLAN (_ie._ `192.168.<VLAN>.0/24`)

.Well-known VLANs
[width="60%",options="header"]
|==============================================
| VLAN ID         | Description
| 0*  | (WILDCARD) MGMT (catch-all)
| 2   | IoT
| 3   | Security
| 30  | Galaxy
| 40  | Odyssey
| 50  | Downstairs
| 60  | Squirrel
| 66  | Alien (_Not Recognized_)
| 8   | Default
| 80  | ToonTown
|==============================================

**Note**: _VLAN 0 is a catch-all/fallback if a valid VLAN is not assigned._

=== Authentication

- Primarily via RADIUS.
- Credentials stored in Password Manager.
- RADIUS ports (1812, 1813) not exposed to users.

=== Service Discovery

* Minimal by Default.
** mDNS / SSDP / LLDP are prohibited.
** VLANs should be isolated from each other.


=== Gateway _("Controller")_

* Currently: UDMPRO
* Future: USG-3

==== Ports & Protocols

==== Userland ports
The following ports **SHOULD** be opened (_only_) to most devices the connect on
this network. Care **MUST** be given to any ports with asterisks as they signal
additional considerations must be taken before opening them to users.
